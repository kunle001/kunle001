Hi there, I'm Oluwole! 🙋‍♂️ I'm a software engineer and data scientist with experience in machine learning and software engineering (particularly Backend Development). 🔬💻 I'm passionate about building innovative solutions and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. 🚀

Here are some of the specific skills and technologies that I've worked with in the past: 🛠️

Programming languages: Python, JavaScript|TypeScript 🐍🌐
Frameworks and libraries: TensorFlow, Sklearn Libaries, Keras, PyTorch, Flask, React, Django, node.js, Express.js 📚🔍
Tools: Git, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Android Studio 🛠️💻

As a software engineer and data scientist, I have a diverse range of skills and experience that make me a valuable collaborator for innovative projects. 🤝 In particular, I have a strong background in machine learning, with experience deploying models and creating usable solutions. I'm especially interested in natural language processing and have worked on several projects in this area. I'm also experienced in back-end development and data science more broadly, having collaborated on a variety of projects that require me to draw on both sets of skills. 💪

I have worked on a card fraud detector model which is able to detect fraudulent act on a card, using my Machine learning and software engineering skill. you can check it out on : https://cardfraud.herokuapp.com/ 💳🕵️‍♂️

I have also build several Functioning REST Api's, with complex functionalities, amongst is an apartment finding and rentage api, you can check it out here: https://github.com/kunle001/mooveX, also an Onliine Language School: https://github.com/kunle001/OXLS. 🏢👨‍🎓

As a Database Administrator and Backend Developer, I collaborated with a team of three Engineers to create https://maveenfleet.co.uk, a dynamic platform for recruiting and mentoring individuals interested in the tech industry. Through my expertise in database administration and website design, I helped deliver a seamless user experience and drive positive outcomes for our users. 💼🌐

As a Data Scientist mentor at a leading tech institute, I have extensive experience teaching both Data Science 1 and Data Science 2. In these courses, I cover everything from Python programming and Data Visualization to advanced machine learning models like Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks. My approach to mentorship emphasizes practical application, teaching students how to build scalable models and deploy them to production. I foster a collaborative and inclusive learning environment, where students can develop both technical and interpersonal skills necessary to succeed in the data science industry. 👨‍🏫💡

I'm passionate about working on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with technology and solve real-world problems. Whether it's creating recommender systems or developing sophisticated software engineering solutions, I thrive on the challenge of building something truly innovative. 🔥💡

With my experience and passion for innovation, I'm eager to collaborate on projects that bring together machine learning, software engineering, and data science. If you're looking for a creative, driven, and collaborative partner for your next project, please don't hesitate to reach out! 🤝
