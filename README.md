🚀 Welcome to my GitHub hub! I'm Olanipekun Adekunle, a dynamic software engineer dedicated to transforming ideas into reality. Dive into my world of cutting-edge solutions and stay ahead of tech trends with me.

### Skills & Expertise 🛠️

Specializing in robust backend development, I craft reliable REST APIs using Node.js, Express, Chi, and Golang. Microservices are my playground—I build efficient RPCs with gRPC and Golang, enhancing service independence. Harnessing RabbitMQ, I optimize communication within microservices. Seamlessly, I deploy on AWS and Azure, leveraging services like Elastic Container Repository, EC2, and S3, EKS, AKS(Azure kubernetes services), ACS(Azure container services) to amplify my DevOps prowess, I also specialize in creating seamless Continous integration and Deployment CI/CD pipelines with Azure Devops and Github Actions.


But it doesn't stop there! My recent project, **foneToHome**, blends React.js for frontend magic with Express and Node.js powering the backend. Get ready for a groundbreaking solution to apartment-finding challenges in Lagos.
