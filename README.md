📚 Tools: TensorFlow, Sklearn, Keras, PyTorch, Flask, React, Django, node.js, Express.js
💻 Extras: Git, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Android Studio

My standout talents? I excel at both machine learning and creating the technical backend of software. I have a knack for simplifying intricate concepts and making data come alive. I've also crafted some impressive projects focused on understanding and working with human language. 💪

Take a look at my GitHub highlights:

1. Card Fraud Detector 🕵️‍♂️: I've whipped up a nifty model to spot those sneaky fraudulent transactions. Check it out at: [Card Fraud Detector](https://github.com/kunle001/card-fraud)

2. Rain Predictor ☔: I built an app that predicts weather conditions with 95% accuracy. Want to stay dry? Have a look here: [Rain Predictor](https://github.com/kunle001/Rain-Predictor)

3. Real-Time Chat App 💬: Ever wanted to chat in real-time? I've got you covered with a slick socket.io-powered chat app: [Chat Now](https://github.com/kunle001/chat-now)

4. Ticket Marketplace 🎫: Score hard-to-find tickets with my microservice-driven app. Scalability? You bet! [Ticket Marketplace](https://github.com/kunle001/ticketting)

5. Functioning REST APIs 🏢: I've whipped up cool APIs, from apartment hunting to online language schooling. Peek at them here: [Apartment Finder API](https://github.com/kunle001/mooveX), [Online Language School API](https://github.com/kunle001/oxford)

In the background (Backend), I've been the driving force behind [MavenFleet.co.uk](https://mavenfleet.co.uk), a visionary platform that empowers tech enthusiasts to embark on their journeys. As the backend developer, I collaborated closely with two frontend engineers to bring this project to life.

Teaching is my jam too! I've mentored in Data Science, guiding students through the exciting world of Python, data visualization, and powerful machine learning. Hands-on is my motto, preparing them for the data science realm.

I'm all about breaking tech boundaries and tackling real-world puzzles. Whether it's mind-blowing recommender systems or elegant software solutions, I'm up for the challenge. Let's team up! 🤝
